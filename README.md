# Data for the INSTANT Neuronal Spike-Train ANalysis Toolbox package

This repository contains spike-train data for the INSTANT Neuronal Spike-Train ANalysis Toolbox available at
[http://github.com/drnil/instant](http://github.com/drnil/instant).

Fourteen recorded sample spike trains are available in the
ZIP archive `spike-train-data.zip` or alternatively, in the
Base64-encoded ZIP archive `spike-train-data.txt`. These spike trains
were recorded by [Henrik JÃ¶rntell at the Department of Experimental
Medical Science at Lund University](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/henrik-j%C3%B6rntell). The file can be decoded under the
Microsoft Windows operating systems using the command

    certutil -decode spike-train-data.txt spike-train-data.zip

Please see the [INSTANT repository](http://github.com/drnil/instant) and the manual `instant-manual.pdf` for details.
